<h1>The Best Movies According to Samuel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Top Gun Maverick</h3>
<p>The stunts and action sequences really appeal to me.</p>
<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>A heartfelt story about a gifted young man looking for someone to take a chance on him.</p>
<h3>Paper Towns</h3>
<p>A really underated movie in my opinion, about how your fantasies may not always be true. And a person may just be a normal person.</p>
